  intro: "Particles are short words that come after a noun and tell you its job in the sentence: topic, subject, object, place, time, and so on. Japanese word order is flexible because the particles carry that information. After the particles come です, polite verbs with ます in the present and past, the two kinds of adjective, and requests with てください. Each lesson has a short explanation, examples and a drill.",
