// Korean grammar for the Grammar Learner, one level on every lesson. Written for this project.
// Examples are [Korean, romanization, English]; {braces} mark the particle or ending.
// Drills are { q, en, options, answer, why }; ＿ is the blank.
//
// Sources (open / educational; attested constructions — original example sentences):
// - National Institute of Korean Language (국립국어원) grammar notes and 표준국어대사전
//   entries for particles, -았/었-, 안/못, -고 싶다, -(으)ㄹ 것이다, -고 있다, -고/-지만/-아서·어서

// - Wiktionary Korean lemmas and “Korean grammar” overview (CC BY-SA): 은/는, 이/가, 을/를,

// - Wikipedia “Korean grammar” / “Revised Romanization of Korean” (CC BY-SA) for overview
//   and romanization; romanization in this file follows RR.
// - In-repo languages/hangul/reference.json past-negative, want, future, connectors cards
//   (same beginner seam; examples here are original).
// - National Institute of Korean Language educational grammar for 받침 (seven final
//   sounds and liaison), -(으)시-, humble 드리다/여쭙다/뵙다, 한다체, and written

// Each lesson has a level: absolute-beginner, beginner, beginner-intermediate,
// intermediate, advanced-intermediate, advanced. The drill shape is unchanged.
// TOPIK levels are estimates written for this project: TOPIK publishes level descriptions, not grammar lists. TOPIK I covers levels 1 and 2, TOPIK II levels 3 to 6. Each lesson's summary ends with its estimated level; a range (2–3) means it's commonly taught at either.

  "intro": "Korean puts the verb last and marks each noun with a particle. Every lesson has a level. Absolute beginner is Hangul: consonants, vowels, and syllable blocks with no final letter. Beginner is batchim (받침), the particles 은/는, 이/가, 을/를, and 에/에서, and 이에요/예요. Beginner-intermediate is 해요체: -아요/-어요, the polite past, 안 and 못, -고 싶어요, -(으)ㄹ 거예요, and -고 있어요. Intermediate is connective endings. Advanced-intermediate is honorifics. Advanced is the plain written style used in news. Romanization follows the Revised Romanization of Korean. TOPIK doesn't publish official grammar lists, so the TOPIK level after each lesson is an estimate, and a range like 2–3 means it often comes up at both.",
