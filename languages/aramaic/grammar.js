// Biblical Aramaic first grammar for the Grammar Learner. Written for this project.
// Examples are [Aramaic, transliteration, English]; {braces} mark the point of the lesson. Example sentences are quoted from Daniel and Ezra (public domain) with our own translations; references are in the English.
// Aramaic is written without vowel points, in the square script it shares with Hebrew. Transliteration is simplified: kh is the throaty sound in Bach.

  "title": "Aramaic first grammar",
  "intro": "Biblical Aramaic is the Aramaic of parts of Daniel and Ezra, close to the Imperial Aramaic of the Persian empire. It is written right to left in the same letters as Hebrew, and many words look alike, but the grammar has its own habits: “the” is an ending, not a prefix; “of” is a separate little word; and verbs tell the story with a short past tense and a participle. These lessons cover the ending for “the”, the word די, pronouns and sentences without “to be”, איתי for “there is”, and the past tense.",
