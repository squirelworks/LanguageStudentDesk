// 72 lessons. The first 12 were the beginner seam; lessons 13–72 write out every point that was only planned before, plus 还是/或者, 有点儿/一点儿, doubled verbs, duration, 就/才 and 对/跟.
// HSK levels are estimates written for this project, not taken from the official grammar list (which has no reuse license). The bands follow the earliest estimated level: HSK 1 absolute-beginner or beginner, 2 beginner, 3 beginner-intermediate, 4 intermediate, 5 advanced-intermediate, 6 and 7–9 advanced. Each lesson's summary and each planned point's title ends with its estimate; a range (2–3) means it's commonly taught at either.

  "intro": "Chinese words never change their form: there are no endings for tense, number or gender. Meaning is carried by word order and by a handful of small words. Every lesson has a level. Absolute beginner and beginner are 是, 很, 不 and 没, 吗, 的, measure words, 了, 在, 过, 比, question words, 也 and 都, time order, 已经, 是…的, 得 and the result complements. Beginner-intermediate adds direction and potential complements, 把, 被, duration, 就 and 才, and the common two-part links: 越…越, 一边…一边, 先…然后, 如果…就. Intermediate is 既然, 连…都, 不仅…而且, 无论…都 and the formal 对于 and 由于. Advanced-intermediate and advanced are written Chinese: 而, 将, 以…为, 所, 之, 其. The HSK level after each point is an estimate, and a range like 2–3 means it often comes up at both.",
