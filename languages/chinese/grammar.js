// Mandarin Chinese first grammar for the Grammar Learner. Written for this project.
// Examples are [characters, pinyin, English]; {braces} mark the point of the lesson.
// Drills are { q, en, options, answer, why }; ＿ is the blank.
//
// Sources (open / educational; attested textbook constructions — original example sentences):
// - Li, Charles N. & Thompson, Sandra A. (1981), Mandarin Chinese: A Functional Reference
//   Grammar (University of California Press): 了 aspect/change, 在 location and progressive,
//   会/能/可以 ability and permission, 过 experiential, 比 comparatives.
// - Wiktionary Mandarin entries and Chinese grammar lemmas (CC BY-SA): 了, 在, 正在, 会,
//   能, 可以, 想, 要, 过, 比, 没有, measure words, 的.
// - Wikipedia “Chinese grammar” / “Chinese particles” (CC BY-SA) for particle overview.
// - HSK Standard Course vocabulary bands 1–2 for common lemma choice only (examples original).
// Lessons 1–6 unchanged; 7–12 deepen the same beginner seam (aspect, place, modals, want,
// experience, comparison). Pinyin marks tones; tone sandhi is written as spoken (bú shì, etc.).
// HSK levels are estimates written for this project, not taken from the official grammar list (which has no reuse license). The bands follow the earliest estimated level: HSK 1 absolute-beginner or beginner, 2 beginner, 3 beginner-intermediate, 4 intermediate, 5 advanced-intermediate, 6 and 7–9 advanced. Each lesson's summary and each planned point's title ends with its estimate; a range (2–3) means it's commonly taught at either.

  "intro": "Chinese words never change their form: there are no endings for tense, number or gender. Meaning is carried by word order and by a handful of small words. Lessons 1–6 cover 是, 很 with adjectives, 不 and 没, 吗, 的, and measure words. Lessons 7–12 add 了, 在, 会・能・可以, 想・要, 过, and 比. The HSK level after each point is an estimate, and a range like 2–3 means it often comes up at both.",
