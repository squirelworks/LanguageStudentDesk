// Kannada first grammar for the Grammar Learner. Written for this project.
// Examples are [Kannada, transliteration, English]; {braces} mark the point of the lesson.
// Drills are { q, en, options, answer, why }; ＿ is the blank.
// CEFR levels are estimates written for this project. The CEFR describes what a learner can do, not which grammar to learn, so no official grammar list exists for it. The official CEFR global scale (Council of Europe, Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, 2001), first sentence of each level: A1 "Can understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type." A2 "Can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance (e.g. very basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment)." B1 "Can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work, school, leisure, etc." B2 "Can understand the main ideas of complex text on both concrete and abstract topics, including technical discussions in his/her field of specialisation." C1 "Can understand a wide range of demanding, longer texts, and recognise implicit meaning." C2 "Can understand with ease virtually everything heard or read." The copyright of the scales belongs to the Council of Europe; these are short quotations.
// Each lesson's summary and each planned point's title ends with its estimated CEFR level; a range (A2–B1) means it's commonly taught at either. The level band is the earliest one: A1 absolute-beginner or beginner, A2 beginner-intermediate, B1 intermediate, B2 advanced-intermediate, C1 and C2 advanced.
// 72 lessons, from A1 to C1. 66 lessons were added to cover the rest of the beginner path and the main intermediate and advanced points.

  "title": "Kannada first grammar",
  "intro": "Kannada is a Dravidian language: the verb comes last, its ending shows who did it (including he, she or it), and case endings join the end of the noun. The 72 lessons run from A1 to C1. They start with sentences without “is”, the present tense, ಇಲ್ಲ and ಅಲ್ಲ, questions and case endings, then add the past, -ಬೇಕು for want and must, participles, -ಅರೆ for “if” and ಎಂದು for reported speech, and end with the passive, spoken Kannada and the connectors and sandhi of written Kannada. The transliteration is simplified: a long vowel is doubled (aa, ii, uu).",
