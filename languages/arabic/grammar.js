// Arabic sentence basics (Modern Standard Arabic) for the Grammar Learner. Written for this project.
// Examples are [Arabic, transliteration, English]; {braces} mark the point of the lesson.
// Drills are { q, en, options, answer, why }; ＿ is the blank.

// Sources (open / educational; attested MSA constructions — original example sentences):
// - Wiktionary Arabic lemmas and grammar notes (CC BY-SA): ال, ة, هذا/هذه, possessive
//   suffixes, في/على/من/إلى, independent pronouns, كتب past/present conjugations, هل/ما/من/أين,
//   لا/ما/ليس negation, إضافة (construct state).
// - Wikipedia “Arabic grammar”, “Modern Standard Arabic”, “Arabic verbs”, “Iḍāfah”

  "intro": "These lessons cover the building blocks of Modern Standard Arabic. Lessons 1–6 cover ال, masculine and feminine, sentences without “is”, هذا / هذه, attached possessives, and في / على / من / إلى. Lessons 7–12 add independent pronouns, the present and past of كتب, questions with هل / ما / من / أين, لا / ما / ليس, and the iḍāfa construct. Arabic is read right to left and short vowels are usually not written; the transliteration under each example shows how it sounds.",
