// Arabic sentence basics (Modern Standard Arabic) for the Grammar Learner. Written for this project.
// Examples are [Arabic, transliteration, English]; {braces} mark the point of the lesson.
// Drills are { q, en, options, answer, why }; ＿ is the blank.
//
// Sources (open / educational; attested MSA constructions — original example sentences):
// - Wiktionary Arabic lemmas and grammar notes (CC BY-SA): ال, ة, هذا/هذه, possessive
//   suffixes, في/على/من/إلى, independent pronouns, كتب past/present conjugations, هل/ما/من/أين,
//   لا/ما/ليس negation, إضافة (construct state).
// - Wikipedia “Arabic grammar”, “Modern Standard Arabic”, “Arabic verbs”, “Iḍāfah”
//   (CC BY-SA) for beginner overview of nominal sentences, imperfect/perfect, questions,
//   negation, and the construct.
// - In-repo languages/arabic/reference.json cards (pronouns, past-present, idafa, sun-moon,
//   nominal-sentences, gender-agreement) — same beginner seam; examples here are original.
// - Open educational MSA references (OpenArabic.org grammar map / basic sentences overview)
//   for particle inventory only; wording and drills are original to this pack.
// CEFR levels are estimates written for this project. The CEFR describes what a learner can do, not which grammar to learn, so no official grammar list exists for it. The official CEFR global scale (Council of Europe, Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, 2001), first sentence of each level: A1 "Can understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type." A2 "Can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance (e.g. very basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment)." B1 "Can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work, school, leisure, etc." B2 "Can understand the main ideas of complex text on both concrete and abstract topics, including technical discussions in his/her field of specialisation." C1 "Can understand a wide range of demanding, longer texts, and recognise implicit meaning." C2 "Can understand with ease virtually everything heard or read." The copyright of the scales belongs to the Council of Europe; these are short quotations.
// Each lesson's summary and each planned point's title ends with its estimated CEFR level; a range (A2–B1) means it's commonly taught at either. The level band is the earliest one: A1 absolute-beginner or beginner, A2 beginner-intermediate, B1 intermediate, B2 advanced-intermediate, C1 and C2 advanced.
// 72 lessons, from A1 to C1. 60 lessons were added to bring Arabic in line with the other full courses.
// Transliteration shows short vowels and writes sun-letter assimilation as spoken.

  "intro": "These lessons cover Modern Standard Arabic from the first sentence to formal written style. The original 12 lessons cover ال, gender, sentences without “is”, demonstratives, possessives, prepositions, pronouns, the present and past, questions, negation and the iḍāfa. Later lessons add numbers, the dual and plurals, كان and its sisters, the future and the moods, the derived verb forms, participles and verbal nouns, conditionals, the passive, and the accusative constructions of formal Arabic. Arabic is read right to left and short vowels are usually not written; the transliteration under each example shows how it sounds. The CEFR level after each point (A1 to C2) is an estimate.",
