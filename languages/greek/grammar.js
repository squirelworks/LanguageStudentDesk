// Modern Greek first grammar for the Grammar Learner. Written for this project.
// Examples are [Greek, romanization, English]; {braces} mark the point of the lesson.
// Drills are { q, en, options, answer, why }; ＿ is the blank.
//
// Sources (open / educational; attested Modern Greek — original example sentences):
// - Wiktionary Modern Greek lemmas and grammar notes (CC BY-SA): είμαι, έχω;
//   enclitic possessives μου/σου/του/της/μας/σας/τους; weak object clitics
//   με/σε/τον/την/το/μας/σας/τους; future particle θα; να-clauses with θέλω /
//   μπορώ / πρέπει; aorist stems έγραψα, μίλησα, πήγα, είδα, είπα, ήρθα.
// - Wikipedia “Modern Greek grammar”, “Greek language”, “Modern Greek” (CC BY-SA)
//   for beginner overview of possessives, clitic pronouns, θα-future, subjunctive
//   with να, and aorist (perfective past) vs present.
// - In-repo languages/greek/reference.json and vocab.js — same Desk pack lemmas
//   and romanization style (accent on the stressed vowel).
// CEFR levels are estimates written for this project. The CEFR describes what a learner can do, not which grammar to learn, so no official grammar list exists for it. The official CEFR global scale (Council of Europe, Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, 2001), first sentence of each level: A1 "Can understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type." A2 "Can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance (e.g. very basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment)." B1 "Can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work, school, leisure, etc." B2 "Can understand the main ideas of complex text on both concrete and abstract topics, including technical discussions in his/her field of specialisation." C1 "Can understand a wide range of demanding, longer texts, and recognise implicit meaning." C2 "Can understand with ease virtually everything heard or read." The copyright of the scales belongs to the Council of Europe; these are short quotations.
// Each lesson's summary and each planned point's title ends with its estimated CEFR level; a range (A2–B1) means it's commonly taught at either. The level band is the earliest one: A1 absolute-beginner or beginner, A2 beginner-intermediate, B1 intermediate, B2 advanced-intermediate, C1 and C2 advanced.
// 72 lessons, from A1 to C1. 60 lessons were added to cover every point in the earlier plan and the rest of a standard course.

  "intro": "Modern Greek marks the subject on the verb, so “I” and “you” are usually left out. Every noun is masculine, feminine or neuter, and the article in front of it shows which. Seventy-two lessons run from “to be”, the article and the present tense through the cases, the aorist and imperfect, να and θα, to conditionals, participles, clitic doubling and formal Greek. The romanization follows modern pronunciation, with an accent on the stressed vowel. The CEFR level after each point (A1 to C2) is an estimate, and a range like A2–B1 means it often comes up at both.",
