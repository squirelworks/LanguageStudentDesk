// Bengali first grammar for the Grammar Learner. Written for this project.
// Examples are [Bengali, transliteration, English]; {braces} mark the point of the lesson.
// Drills are { q, en, options, answer, why }; ＿ is the blank.
//
// Sources (open / educational; attested Standard Bengali constructions — original example sentences):
// - Wiktionary Bengali lemmas and conjugation tables (CC BY-SA): খাওয়া, করা, যাওয়া, দেওয়া,
//   পারা — present continuous (-চ্ছি/-ছ/-ছেন), simple past (-লাম/-লে/-লেন), future (-ব/-বে/-বেন),
//   infinitive -তে + পারা, imperatives (খাও/খান, দাও/দিন).
// - Wikipedia “Bengali grammar” (CC BY-SA): progressive/perfect/past/future overview, imperative
//   mood by politeness, objective case -কে, postpositions (থেকে).
// - In-repo languages/bengali/reference.json (present endings, -কে, থেকে, everyday phrases) —
//   same beginner seam; examples here are original.
// CEFR levels are estimates written for this project. The CEFR describes what a learner can do, not which grammar to learn, so no official grammar list exists for it. The official CEFR global scale (Council of Europe, Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, 2001), first sentence of each level: A1 "Can understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type." A2 "Can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance (e.g. very basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment)." B1 "Can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work, school, leisure, etc." B2 "Can understand the main ideas of complex text on both concrete and abstract topics, including technical discussions in his/her field of specialisation." C1 "Can understand a wide range of demanding, longer texts, and recognise implicit meaning." C2 "Can understand with ease virtually everything heard or read." The copyright of the scales belongs to the Council of Europe; these are short quotations.
// Each lesson's summary and each planned point's title ends with its estimated CEFR level; a range (A2–B1) means it's commonly taught at either. The level band is the earliest one: A1 absolute-beginner or beginner, A2 beginner-intermediate, B1 intermediate, B2 advanced-intermediate, C1 and C2 advanced.
// 72 lessons, from A1 to C1. 60 lessons were added to cover the rest of everyday and literary Bengali grammar; transliteration follows the original 12 lessons (simplified; o for inherent অ; chh for ছ).

  "intro": "Bengali (Bangla) puts the verb last and has no grammatical gender: the verb changes for the person and for how polite you are, but never for he or she. Present-tense sentences often need no “is”. The 72 lessons run from A1 to C1. They start with sentences without “to be”, verbs and politeness, saying no, questions, classifiers and the basic tenses, then add the perfect and habitual past, the -তে infinitive and the conjunctive -এ, “must”, “like” and “want”, conditionals with -লে and যদি, relative clauses, compound verbs, causatives and the passive, and end with unreal conditions, echo words, “while” and “as soon as”, formal connectors and the literary সাধু ভাষা. The transliteration is simplified: o is the short vowel most consonants carry, and ch, th, kh are breathy sounds.",
