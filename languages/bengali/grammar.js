// Bengali first grammar for the Grammar Learner. Written for this project.
// Examples are [Bengali, transliteration, English]; {braces} mark the point of the lesson.
// Drills are { q, en, options, answer, why }; ＿ is the blank.
//
// Sources (open / educational; attested Standard Bengali constructions — original example sentences):
// - Wiktionary Bengali lemmas and conjugation tables (CC BY-SA): খাওয়া, করা, যাওয়া, দেওয়া,
//   পারা — present continuous (-চ্ছি/-ছ/-ছেন), simple past (-লাম/-লে/-লেন), future (-ব/-বে/-বেন),
//   infinitive -তে + পারা, imperatives (খাও/খান, দাও/দিন).
// - Wikipedia “Bengali grammar” (CC BY-SA): progressive/perfect/past/future overview, imperative
//   mood by politeness, objective case -কে, postpositions (থেকে).
// - In-repo languages/bengali/reference.json (present endings, -কে, থেকে, everyday phrases) —
//   same beginner seam; examples here are original.
// Lessons 1–6 unchanged; 7–12 deepen the same seam (progressive, past, future, -কে,
// imperatives, পারা). Transliteration matches lessons 1–6 (simplified; o for inherent অ;
// chh for ছ).

  "intro": "Bengali (Bangla) puts the verb last and has no grammatical gender: the verb changes for the person and for how polite you are, but never for he or she. Present-tense sentences often need no “is”. Lessons 1–6 cover sentences without “to be” and আছে, verbs and politeness, saying no, questions, “the” with -টা and plurals, and “my” and “in”. Lessons 7–12 add the progressive with -ছি, the simple past, the future, object -কে, polite requests, and “can” with পারা. The transliteration is simplified: o is the short vowel most consonants carry, and ch, th, kh are breathy sounds.",
