// Thai first grammar for the Grammar Learner. Written for this project.
// Examples are [Thai, romanization, English]; {braces} mark the point of the lesson.
// Drills are { q, en, options, answer, why }; ＿ is the blank.
//
// Sources (open / educational; attested Thai constructions — original example sentences):
// - Wiktionary Thai lemmas and grammar notes (CC BY-SA): ได้ (ability / permission after
//   the verb), อยาก / อยากได้, ชอบ, ต้อง / ไม่ต้อง, ควร, ห้าม, ให้ (give; let; for),
//   กว่า, ที่สุด, directional ไป / มา after verbs.
// - Wikipedia “Thai language”, “Thai grammar” (CC BY-SA) for beginner overview of
//   analytic verbs, serial verb constructions, and post-verbal ได้ vs pre-verbal modals.
// - In-repo languages/thai/reference.json (markers, classifiers, pronouns) and vocab.js —
//   same Desk pack lemmas; romanization without tone marks matches the original 6 lessons.
// CEFR levels are estimates written for this project. The CEFR describes what a learner can do, not which grammar to learn, so no official grammar list exists for it. The official CEFR global scale (Council of Europe, Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, 2001), first sentence of each level: A1 "Can understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type." A2 "Can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance (e.g. very basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment)." B1 "Can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work, school, leisure, etc." B2 "Can understand the main ideas of complex text on both concrete and abstract topics, including technical discussions in his/her field of specialisation." C1 "Can understand a wide range of demanding, longer texts, and recognise implicit meaning." C2 "Can understand with ease virtually everything heard or read." The copyright of the scales belongs to the Council of Europe; these are short quotations.
// Each lesson's summary and each planned point's title ends with its estimated CEFR level; a range (A2–B1) means it's commonly taught at either. The level band is the earliest one: A1 absolute-beginner or beginner, A2 beginner-intermediate, B1 intermediate, B2 advanced-intermediate, C1 and C2 advanced.
// 72 lessons, from A1 to C1. 60 lessons were added to cover the rest of everyday and formal Thai grammar; romanization follows the original 12 lessons (simple, without tone marks).

  "intro": "Thai words never change their form: no endings for tense, person, plural or gender. Instead, word order and small helper words carry the meaning, and the speaker's own gender shows up in the polite word at the end of a sentence. The 72 lessons run from A1 to C1. They start with pronouns and ครับ / ค่ะ, เป็น / อยู่ / มี, ไม่ and ไหม, time words, classifiers, ได้, อยาก, ต้อง and ให้, then add question words, numbers and the clock, กำลัง, จะ, เคย and แล้ว / ยัง, the mood particles, relative ที่, ถ้า, time and purpose clauses, verb chains, result verbs, the passive with ถูก and causatives, and end with unreal conditions, ยิ่ง … ยิ่ง, การ / ความ nouns, ไว้ and ซะ, formal connectors and royal vocabulary. The romanization is a simple one without tone marks; listen to each word with text to speech to hear the tone.",
