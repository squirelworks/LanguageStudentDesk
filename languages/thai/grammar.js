// Thai first grammar for the Grammar Learner. Written for this project.
// Examples are [Thai, romanization, English]; {braces} mark the point of the lesson.
// Drills are { q, en, options, answer, why }; ＿ is the blank.
//
// Sources (open / educational; attested Thai constructions — original example sentences):
// - Wiktionary Thai lemmas and grammar notes (CC BY-SA): ได้ (ability / permission after
//   the verb), อยาก / อยากได้, ชอบ, ต้อง / ไม่ต้อง, ควร, ห้าม, ให้ (give; let; for),
//   กว่า, ที่สุด, directional ไป / มา after verbs.
// - Wikipedia “Thai language”, “Thai grammar” (CC BY-SA) for beginner overview of
//   analytic verbs, serial verb constructions, and post-verbal ได้ vs pre-verbal modals.
// - In-repo languages/thai/reference.json (markers, classifiers, pronouns) and vocab.js —
//   same Desk pack lemmas; romanization without tone marks matches lessons 1–6.
// Lessons 1–6 unchanged; 7–12 deepen the same beginner seam (ability, want/like, must,
// ให้, comparison, directionals).

  "intro": "Thai words never change their form: no endings for tense, person, plural or gender. Instead, word order and small helper words carry the meaning, and the speaker's own gender shows up in the polite word at the end of a sentence. Lessons 1–6 cover pronouns and ครับ / ค่ะ, เป็น / อยู่ / มี, word order and describing words, ไม่ and ไหม, time words, and classifiers. Lessons 7–12 add ได้, อยาก / ชอบ, ต้อง / ควร, ให้, กว่า / ที่สุด, and directional ไป / มา. The romanization is a simple one without tone marks; listen to each word with text to speech to hear the tone.",
