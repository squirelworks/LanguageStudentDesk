  "intro": "Taiwan Mandarin (台灣華語) is written in traditional characters. Schools teach the sounds with Zhuyin (注音), and these lessons print Zhuyin beside pinyin. Local words are used from the start: 捷運 for the metro, 計程車 for a taxi, 影片 for a video, 華語 for the language. The six levels step up in order: greetings and sounds, daily sentences, particles and aspect, connected speech, formal news-style writing, then nuance between patterns that look alike.",
