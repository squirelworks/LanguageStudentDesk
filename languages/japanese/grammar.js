// Japanese particles and first verbs for the Grammar Learner. Written for this project.
// Examples are [Japanese, romaji, English]; {braces} mark the particle.
// Drills are { q, en, options, answer, why }; ＿ is the blank.
// JLPT levels are estimates. The JLPT stopped publishing vocabulary, kanji and grammar lists with the 2010 revision; its FAQ says such "a list of vocabulary, kanji and grammar items was not necessarily appropriate" (https://www.jlpt.jp/e/faq/).
// The official level summaries (https://www.jlpt.jp/e/about/levelsummary.html): N5 "The ability to understand some basic Japanese." N4 "The ability to understand basic Japanese." N3 "The ability to understand Japanese used in everyday situations to a certain degree." N2 "The ability to understand Japanese used in everyday situations, and in a variety of circumstances to a certain degree." N1 "The ability to understand Japanese used in a variety of circumstances."
// Each lesson's summary and each planned point's title ends with its estimated JLPT level; a range (N4–N3) means it's commonly taught at either. The level band is the earliest one: N5 is absolute-beginner or beginner, N4 beginner-intermediate, N3 intermediate, N2 advanced-intermediate, N1 advanced. The points and estimates are written for this project; no text is taken from a list.
// 73 lessons. Every N5 planned point is written; N4 to N1 points are written in teaching order, and the ones not written yet stay in the plan.

  "title": "Japanese particles and first verbs",
  "intro": "Particles are short words that come after a noun and tell you its job in the sentence: topic, subject, object, place, time, and so on. Japanese word order is flexible because the particles carry that information. After the particles come です, polite verbs with ます, adjectives, and the て form with its patterns (ている, てもいい, てしまう, ておく, てみる). Then plain forms, wanting and inviting, comparing, the four conditionals (ば, たら, と, なら), the potential, passive and causative, giving and receiving, guesses (そう, ようだ, かもしれない) and keigo. The last lessons reach N3 to N1 patterns such as うちに, によって, わけにはいかない and ならでは. The JLPT doesn't publish official grammar lists, so the JLPT level after each point is an estimate, and a range like N4–N3 means it often comes up at both.",
