  "intro": "Modern Hebrew is written right to left, usually without vowel marks, and builds words from three-consonant roots. There is no “am / is / are” in the present tense, “the” is a single letter joined to the word, and nouns, adjectives and verbs all mark masculine or feminine. Lessons 1–6 cover sentences without “to be”, ה־ for “the”, gender and adjectives, the present tense, יש and אין for “there is” and “have”, and the little prepositions that join the front of a word. Lessons 7–12 add the past and future of כתב, את before a definite object, question words, wanting and ability with an infinitive, and סמיכות (“X of Y”). Transliteration follows modern Israeli pronunciation: ch is the throaty sound in Bach.",
