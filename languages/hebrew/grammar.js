// Modern Hebrew first grammar for the Grammar Learner. Written for this project.
// Examples are [Hebrew, transliteration, English]; {braces} mark the point of the lesson.
// Drills are { q, en, options, answer, why }; ＿ is the blank.

// Sources (open / educational; attested Modern Hebrew — original example sentences):
// - Wiktionary Modern Hebrew lemmas and conjugations (CC BY-SA): כתב (pa'al past /
//   present / future / לכתוב), את (definite direct-object marker; אוֹתִי…), מה / מי /
//   איפה / מתי / למה / איך, רוצה / יכול / צריך, בית / ספר construct forms, בית ספר.
// - Wikipedia “Modern Hebrew grammar”, “Hebrew language”, “Construct state”

// - In-repo languages/hebrew/reference.json (et, present, pronouns, numbers) and
//   vocab.js — same Desk pack lemmas; unpointed spelling and Israeli transliteration
//   match the original 6 lessons (ch = throaty sound in Bach; no niqqud in examples).
// CEFR levels are estimates written for this project. The CEFR describes what a learner can do, not which grammar to learn, so no official grammar list exists for it. The official CEFR global scale (Council of Europe, Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, 2001), first sentence of each level: A1 "Can understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type." A2 "Can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance (e.g. very basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment)." B1 "Can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work, school, leisure, etc." B2 "Can understand the main ideas of complex text on both concrete and abstract topics, including technical discussions in his/her field of specialisation." C1 "Can understand a wide range of demanding, longer texts, and recognise implicit meaning." C2 "Can understand with ease virtually everything heard or read." The copyright of the scales belongs to the Council of Europe; these are short quotations.
// Each lesson's summary and each planned point's title ends with its estimated CEFR level; a range (A2–B1) means it's commonly taught at either. The level band is the earliest one: A1 absolute-beginner or beginner, A2 beginner-intermediate, B1 intermediate, B2 advanced-intermediate, C1 and C2 advanced.
// 72 lessons, from A1 to C1. 60 lessons were added to cover the rest of everyday and formal Modern Hebrew grammar; spelling and transliteration follow the original 12 lessons (unpointed; ch = throaty sound in Bach).

  "intro": "Modern Hebrew is written right to left, usually without vowel marks, and builds words from three-consonant roots. There is no “am / is / are” in the present tense, “the” is a single letter joined to the word, and nouns, adjectives and verbs all mark masculine or feminine. The 72 lessons run from A1 to C1. They start with sentences without “to be”, ה־ for “the”, gender, the present tense, יש and אין, and the past and future of כתב, then add numbers, possessive and preposition endings, “was” and “will be”, commands, comparisons, the verb patterns (pi'el, hif'il, hitpa'el, nif'al) and the weak verbs, ש־ clauses, “if”, time and purpose clauses, and end with unreal conditions, verbal nouns, the passives, formal written endings, אינני and the biblical ויאמר. Transliteration follows modern Israeli pronunciation: ch is the throaty sound in Bach.",
