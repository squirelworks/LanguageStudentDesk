// German first grammar for the Grammar Learner. Written for this project.
// Examples are [German, word by word, English]; {braces} mark the point of the lesson.
// Drills are { q, en, options, answer, why }; ＿ is the blank.
//
// Sources (open / educational; standard forms, original example sentences):
// - Hammer's German Grammar and Usage (overview of sein, the present, gender,
//   verb-second order, the accusative, nicht and kein).
// - DW Learn German (https://learngerman.dw.com) A1 patterns: bin/bist/ist,
//   der/die/das, den, and verb-second statements.

// CEFR levels are estimates written for this project. The CEFR describes what a learner can do, not which grammar to learn, so no official grammar list exists for it. The official CEFR global scale (Council of Europe, Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, 2001), first sentence of each level: A1 "Can understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type." A2 "Can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance (e.g. very basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment)." B1 "Can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work, school, leisure, etc." B2 "Can understand the main ideas of complex text on both concrete and abstract topics, including technical discussions in his/her field of specialisation." C1 "Can understand a wide range of demanding, longer texts, and recognise implicit meaning." C2 "Can understand with ease virtually everything heard or read." The copyright of the scales belongs to the Council of Europe; these are short quotations.
// Each lesson's summary and each planned point's title ends with its estimated CEFR level; a range (A2–B1) means it's commonly taught at either. The level band is the earliest one: A1 absolute-beginner or beginner, A2 beginner-intermediate, B1 intermediate, B2 advanced-intermediate, C1 and C2 advanced.
// 72 lessons. The six first lessons are unchanged; lessons 7–72 write out every planned point and add the rest of a standard A1–C1 sequence. Example sentences are original.

  "title": "German first grammar",
  "intro": "German puts the verb in a fixed place, and it marks gender on the article rather than on the noun's ending alone. Every lesson has a level. Absolute beginner and beginner (A1) are sein and haben, the present tense, der/die/das, verb-second order, the accusative, nicht and kein, plurals, numbers and time, W-questions, pronouns in each case, modal and separable verbs, the imperative, the Perfekt and the dative. Beginner-intermediate (A2) adds two-way prepositions, verb-last clauses, reflexive verbs, comparison, adjective endings, the future and the Präteritum. Intermediate (B1) is the genitive, relative clauses, Konjunktiv II, zu-infinitives and the passive. The last lessons (B2 to C1) are the past Konjunktiv II, Konjunktiv I for reported speech, participle phrases and Nominalstil. Nouns are written with a capital letter. The CEFR level after each point (A1 to C2) is an estimate, and a range like A2–B1 means it often comes up at both.",
