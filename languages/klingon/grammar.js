// Klingon verbs and nouns for the Grammar Learner. Written for this project.
// Examples are [Klingon, gloss, English]; {braces} mark the point of the lesson (the prefix, in the grid lessons).
// Lessons with `generate` get drills built from the prefix grid below.
// CEFR levels are estimates written for this project. The CEFR describes what a learner can do, not which grammar to learn, so no official grammar list exists for it. The official CEFR global scale (Council of Europe, Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, 2001), first sentence of each level: A1 "Can understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type." A2 "Can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance (e.g. very basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment)." B1 "Can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work, school, leisure, etc." B2 "Can understand the main ideas of complex text on both concrete and abstract topics, including technical discussions in his/her field of specialisation." C1 "Can understand a wide range of demanding, longer texts, and recognise implicit meaning." C2 "Can understand with ease virtually everything heard or read." The copyright of the scales belongs to the Council of Europe; these are short quotations.
// Each lesson's summary and each planned point's title ends with its estimated CEFR level; a range (A2–B1) means it's commonly taught at either. The level band is the earliest one: A1 absolute-beginner or beginner, A2 beginner-intermediate, B1 intermediate, B2 advanced-intermediate, C1 and C2 advanced.
// 24 lessons, from A1 to B1. 14 lessons were added to cover the rest of the beginner path and the first intermediate points.

Learn the grid once and every verb opens up. The 24 lessons run from A1 to B1. They start with the prefix grid, commands, the everyday verb suffixes, plural and possessive nouns, places and “to be”, then add time words, aspect, need and readiness, questions and numbers, and end with comparison, “when” and “if”, “who” and “in order to”. Romanization is the standard Latin spelling; tick “Show pIqaD” to see each example in Klingon script.",
