// Punjabi first grammar for the Grammar Learner. Written for this project.
// Examples are [Punjabi in Gurmukhi, transliteration, English]; {braces} mark the point of the lesson.
// Drills are { q, en, options, answer, why }; ＿ is the blank.
// CEFR levels are estimates written for this project. The CEFR describes what a learner can do, not which grammar to learn, so no official grammar list exists for it. The official CEFR global scale (Council of Europe, Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, 2001), first sentence of each level: A1 "Can understand and use familiar everyday expressions and very basic phrases aimed at the satisfaction of needs of a concrete type." A2 "Can understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most immediate relevance (e.g. very basic personal and family information, shopping, local geography, employment)." B1 "Can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work, school, leisure, etc." B2 "Can understand the main ideas of complex text on both concrete and abstract topics, including technical discussions in his/her field of specialisation." C1 "Can understand a wide range of demanding, longer texts, and recognise implicit meaning." C2 "Can understand with ease virtually everything heard or read." The copyright of the scales belongs to the Council of Europe; these are short quotations.
// Each lesson's summary and each planned point's title ends with its estimated CEFR level; a range (A2–B1) means it's commonly taught at either. The level band is the earliest one: A1 absolute-beginner or beginner, A2 beginner-intermediate, B1 intermediate, B2 advanced-intermediate, C1 and C2 advanced.
// 72 lessons, from A1 to C1. 66 lessons were added to cover the rest of the beginner path and the main intermediate and advanced points.

  "title": "Punjabi first grammar",
  "intro": "Punjabi puts the verb at the end, uses postpositions after the noun, and gives every noun a gender that adjectives and verbs follow. It is also tonal: a few letters (ਘ, ਝ, ਢ, ਧ, ਭ and ਹ inside a word) change the pitch of the syllable instead of being said with a breath. The 72 lessons run from A1 to C1. They start with “to be”, word order and questions, gender, the present tense, postpositions, and ਦਾ / ਦੀ / ਦੇ for “of”, then add the past with ਨੇ, the future, ਚਾਹੀਦਾ and ਪੈਣਾ for need and must, ਸਕਣਾ, ਜੇ … ਤਾਂ for “if” and ਕਿ for reported speech, and end with the passive, compound verbs, counterfactuals and the connectors of written Punjabi. The transliteration is simplified: a long vowel is doubled (aa, ii, uu) and n after a vowel marks a nasal sound.",
