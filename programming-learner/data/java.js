  intro:
    "Java arrived in 1995 with a promise: compile once, run on any machine that has a Java virtual machine. It became the language of big business systems, Android apps, university courses and tools like Minecraft's original edition. Everything in Java lives inside a class, every variable has a type the compiler checks, and memory is cleaned up for you by the garbage collector. These lessons use Java 21, which added records, switch expressions and <code>var</code> to cut down the typing older Java was known for. Every example is a whole file and shows exactly what it prints. To run one yourself, save it as <code>Main.java</code> and type <code>java Main.java</code>.",
