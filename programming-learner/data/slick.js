// Slick course for the Programming Learner. Written for this project.
// Slick here is Pascal Costanza's s-expression surface syntax for Go
// (the ExaScience / pcostanza project), not the unrelated experimental
// languages that also use the name. The published language is an early
// release and its authors say it may still change, so these lessons stay
// inside what that project states: the Hello World, the shape of a call,
// and the three documented deviations from Go. There is no runner; nothing
// here is executed.

  intro:
    "Slick, in the form published by Pascal Costanza, is a Lisp-shaped way of writing Go. The same language is underneath: types, packages, and the split between statements and expressions. What changes is the surface, which is s-expressions, plus a few Lisp features (macros, quotation, reader tables). It is an early project and its authors do not recommend it for production, because details may still change. The Hello World below is the one in the project README. This course does not run programs; it teaches that published shape and the differences the project itself lists.",
