  title: "JavaScript: the language of the web",
  intro:
    "JavaScript runs in every web browser, so it is the language behind interactive web pages. With Node.js it also runs servers, command-line tools and desktop apps. It was designed in a hurry in 1995 and has some famous oddities, but modern JavaScript, with <code>let</code>, <code>const</code>, arrow functions, classes and <code>async</code>, is a pleasant and very capable language. These lessons teach the language itself, not web pages. Every example is a whole script and shows exactly what it prints. To try one, open your browser's developer console (F12) and paste it in, or save it as <code>hello.js</code> and run <code>node hello.js</code>.",
